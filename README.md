# monorepo-nextjs-emotion-starter

A starter project for a monorepo with a [nextjs]-based workspace that uses [emotion] css-in-js (with SRR support).

This repository was created to capture a monorepo setup that:

- has a workspace having nextjs-based frontend,
- has ready-to-use, top-level testing setup based on jest and [@testing-library/react]

Successive commits add more features and examples.
